          I have a passion for programming and really enjoy solving puzzles and
          seeing my solutions come to life. When I&apos;m not studying, I enjoy
          being out in nature, cooking or cuddling with my kitten Zena.

          I was born and raised down south in Invercargill, New Zealand. I love
          the beach there and also how close it is to some great hiking trails.
          I don&apos;t miss the cold weather and the howling wind.

          I moved to Nelson when I was 19 in order to study Conservation.
          However I had to give up that dream due to health issues. I decided
          that a Web Development Diploma at NMIT interested me, and well, the
          rest is history.

          After completing my diploma my partner and I moved to Christchurch for
          more opportunites for work and study. I am completing my bachelors at
