Wow, Next.js is awesome. I really enjoyed developing my portfolio site with it.

## Stack
For this site I used:
- Next.js (React framework)
- shadcn/ui (Component library)
- MDX (For blog posts)
- Velite (For turning MDX into a blog)

## Inspiration & Resources
[Brian Ruiz - Portfolio](https://www.b-r.io/). A lovely and simply designed portfolio site. I took inspiration from the layout and simplicity.

[Jolly Coding - Next.js Blog Tutorial](https://github.com/jolbol1/nextjs-velite-blog-template?tab=readme-ov-file). This tutorial was a great help in setting up my blog using Velite as I ran into a lot of issues using older methods (contentlayer), also learnt a lot about Shadcn UI.
