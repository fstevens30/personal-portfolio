## About
The final paper in my degree required me to complete a project in an industry envcironment, this is known as the "Capstone Project".

This project was done in collaboration with [MADCAP Dairy Software](https://madcapdairysoftware.com/), a New Zealand based company that develops software solutions for the dairy industry. The aim was to port the Ferrostar library into .NET and provide a working sample application covering basic features of navigation as a proof of concept.

## Ferrostar
[Ferrostar](https://github.com/stadiamaps/Ferrostar) is a modern, open-source navigation library. The core library is written in Rust and officially supports Andriod using Kotlin and iOS using Swift.

## Result
The end result is a working demo application that covers all core featues. This can be seen in the screenshot below:

## Poster
As part of the Capstone Project, I created a poster to summarise the work done. This can be seen below:
