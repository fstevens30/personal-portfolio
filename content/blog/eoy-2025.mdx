# Emerge 2025

With 2025 all done, and barring any major situations occurring, I have officially completed my degree!

It was a great year, for study I focused more on the professional practices side of IT. In the final semester I began an internship with MADCAP (you can read about in my other blog [post](https://flynn-stevens.com/blog/ferrostar-maui)). I really enjoyed the internship and am hoping that I will be privileged enough to continue working with the company. 

The end of year Emerge event at Ara was fantastic and I was extremely comfortable with it after having the opportunity to present at the 2024 event. 

Congratulations to all of my fellow students for being part of the journey, I’m lucky to be friends with you all.
