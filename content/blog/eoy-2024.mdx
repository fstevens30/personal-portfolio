# Emerge 2024

Had a great evening attending the end of year Bachelor of ICT event “Emerge” at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

I was proud to be given the opportunity to show off my work done in BCDE311 - Software Development Project. 

My project was a virtual rendition of the Emerge event. You can visit it with the link below.

Congratulations to all those students who are now finished their degree, it was amazing to see all the work they’ve done this past semester.
